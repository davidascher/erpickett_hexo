    bio: >
      <p style="text-align: left">
      I am a mixed media visual artist.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left">
      Currently I am using found organic materials such as bones and
      driftwood in combination with textiles and traditional needlework to
      explore the recurrence of patterns across the natural world.
      Combining organic objects with the traditions of needlecraft yields
      deeply tactile pieces that encourage seeing familiar aspects of
      nature in a new way. Prior to discovering my artistic vision, I
      earned advanced degrees in Theoretical and Experimental Linguistics.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left">
      In an earlier life, I was a C programmer.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left">
      I currently live in Vancouver, BC, Canada.
